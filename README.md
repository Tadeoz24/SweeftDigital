## About <a name = "about"></a>

A project that helps to see a list of users from an API involves retrieving user information from a remote server using an API (Application Programming Interface). The project may involve developing a web or mobile application that makes requests to the API to retrieve the user data, which can include information such as their picture, first name, last name, and other relevant data.
